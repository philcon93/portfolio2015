# Portfolio Website created in 2015

![](https://db.tt/lgyQ8CXy)

This is the second portfolio website I created for myself and was done in the CMS Wordpress. I created the theme from stratch with a starting understanding of PHP and Wordpress themes.

I use Bootstrap 3 as the css framework and a majority of the content is saved in the Wordpress Plugin 'Pods'.
